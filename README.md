# Reframe Manager

This is an helper application for Mac users, who have _GoPro MAX_ camera. The camera takes 360 degree images and videos, which can be composed afterwards with _GoPro Player_ desktop application. The application allows operating in high resolution or lo-res mode. Unfortunately if one does editing of a video file in lo-res mode, the edit are not automatically transferret to the high resolution version. However, especially with older Macs, which doesn't have HVAC video coded hardware support, editing in low resolution is the only option, the higher resolution is practically unusable.

The Reframe Manager allows users to do the editing in the low resolution, then switch to Hi-Res and launch final rendering there. The application also manages unlimited number of different editions of the same video file, something which is not supported in the _GoPro Player_.

The software has been developed with Swift/XCode.
