<h1>Reframe Manager</h1>

<p>A Mac OSX application for managing reframings of GoPro MAX 360 degree video files. It can
also be used with older Macs without HEVC support to reframe files first in low resolution, and
then open the same reframing in high definition for exporting.
<p>Maybe I'm an old fart, but I like to do my editing with mouse and big screen. I'm also a
cheapskate, whose Macbook Air 2017 wasn't up to the task. Now it is.</p>
</p>
<p>The app is used in conjuction with GoPro Player app, which must be installed on the same
computer.
</p>
<p>I have no connections whatsoever to GoPro, and I made this helper application solely as
an user of their products. Others might find it useful, but I take not any kind of responsibilty
of possible loss of data, hardware or limb. <b>Use at your own risk.</b>

<ol>
  <li><i><b>Open folder</b></i> - The folder containing video files from your GoPro MAX camera</li>
  <li><i><b>Player App folder</b></i> - The app bundle of the GoPro Player app installed on your Mac.
    There should be no need to change this after you have selected the default folder
    once: <i>~/Containers/com.gopro.GoPro-Player/Data/Library/Application Support</i></li>
  <li><i><b>Video</b></i> - Select the video you want to reframe here</li>
  <li><i><b>Video name</b></i> - Renaming this renames all files associated with this video!</li>
  <li><i><b>Launch GoPro Player</b></i> - Create reframing in Low definition and open it for rendering
    in High def, if your Mac doesn't have HEVC hardware support</li>
  <li><i><b>Select the reframing</b></i> you want the Player to use. If the list is empty or nothing
    is selected, a new reframe file will be created.</li>
  <li><i><b>Rename, copy or delete</b></i> selected reframing</li>
</ol>


<h2>Notice!</h2>
<p>When you launch the Player, a message appears. Remember <em>always</em> close the Player completely
  before clicking the <em>Player App has quit</em> button.</p>
